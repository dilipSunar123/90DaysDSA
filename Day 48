Was trying to solve "Balanced Binary Tree" problem but could'nt solve. 

Need to learn more basic problems on tree first I guess.

I didn't expect I'll solve it in one go :D
Solved a very basic level (easy-leetcode) problem "Binary Tree PostOrder Traversal"

Was trying a problem "Min Stack" but something wrong!

Will be trying it tomorrow.

Done for the day!
