No stable internet connection today, so won't be able to code online but still will be coding + revising previous problems. 

Revised + added some edge cases to the problem "Duplicate element in an array" on my local ide. 

Revised some more problems including "Remove Duplicate from a string, set matrix 0"

Tomorrow if the network is stable then, will be first revising the medium level problem solved on gfg and the start with Trees

Done for the day.
