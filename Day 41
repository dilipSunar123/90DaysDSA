#Array #hashmap

Tried solving an easy problem and yes, it does run in O(n^2) time but not able to optimise it so, time limit exceeded..

Problem: Contains Duplicate ||
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/

Solved it using hashmap (editorial). Got to know more about hashmap!

Tried the "Happy Number" problem even today but couldn't. I'll make sure I dont proceed before I complete this problem

Done for the day!
