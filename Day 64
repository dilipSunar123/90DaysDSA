No electricity even today + not feeling well but still will be revising previous problems I did on binary search using pen and paper

Revised 
- First and last occurrence of an element in sorted array
- no of occurrence of a number in a sorted array
- finding an element in a rotated sorted array

Problem for tomorrow "Find min and Max in rotated sorted array"
