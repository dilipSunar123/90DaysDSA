No electricity even today + not feeling well but still will be revising previous problems I did on binary search using pen and paper

Revised 
- First and last occurrence of an element in sorted array
- no of occurrence of a number in a sorted array
- finding an element in a rotated sorted array

Will now be trying to look at 2 more problems of binary search
