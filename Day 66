Was planning to code "Min in a sorted rotated array" but problem is still going on with the electricity. 
So will be thinking logic on some other problem tonight. 

Will code the above problem when electricity's issue is been fixed.

Thought of my own code for the above problem and I'm pretty sure it'll work. Will code it whenever possible. (Nahi lagta Mera code chalega haha...)

Watched one video on the problem on gfg's YouTube channel, and got the logic. Will be coding it tomorrow during the day itself. Light ka koi thikana nahi 

Done for the day!
