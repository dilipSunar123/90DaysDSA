#Array

Simply revised the "Minimum Size Subarray Sum" which I already solved. 

Will now be trying to solve problemns on searching algos.

Ab properly pata chala kaise use mai ata hai binary search :D
Trying a problem on binary search...

Solved an easy level binary search problem "Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted" on leetcode
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/

Now I see, unknowingly I was using binary search to solve my problems on strings.. specifically "Palindrome Strings"

Will try another one..
