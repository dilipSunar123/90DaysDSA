#LinkedList

Was revising previous problems on Linked List and feels like I'm getting confused with the problems I solved. 
WIll try revising them once again(properly) today.


Now clear (a bit)

Will now try solving problems...

Was trying to solve the problem "Split a Circular Linked List into 2 halves" but I guess there is something wrong with this problem in gfg (bug maybe)

Will try another problem...

Won't be able to continue anymore today. Not feeling well even today. 

Done for the day!

Didn't do much today so was checking out some videos on problem on linked list and found another one good problem
