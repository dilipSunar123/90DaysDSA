#LinkedList

Was revising previous problems on Linked List and feels like I'm getting confused with the problems I solved. 
WIll try revising them once again(properly) today.


Now clear (a bit)

Will now try solving problems...

Was trying to solve the problem "Split a Circular Linked List into 2 halves" but I guess there is something wrong with this problem in gfg (bug maybe)
Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/split-a-circular-linked-list-into-two-halves/1/?category[]=Linked%20List&category[]=Linked%20List&page=2&query=category[]Linked%20Listpage2category[]Linked%20List#

Will try another problem...
