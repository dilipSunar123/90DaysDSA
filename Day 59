#Binary Search

Tried solving the same problem as yesterday "Count Element Occurance using Binary Search" but still could not. Will try it later again.

Solved! (Got to learn a lot from this problem - about Binary Search).

Was trying to solve "Search in Bitonic Array" but could not. Will be trying to this tomorrow again.
